Even if while booking the room i have used my card and they could have charged me from it. i had to wait 20 minutes after a long journey and to realize that I only needed to say yes, they can charge me from the booking card. what a waist of 20 minutes after midnight?! 
Finally arrived in the room and no towels or shampoo. went down again and asked for a towel. at first the receptionist didn’t seemed very eager to do that and eventually she brought it to my room.
in the morning I picked the “Amazing” breakfast that the only good thing was the sandwich and no fruit as I would have to expected.
went to the common kitchen at 10 and was not able to take any drinks and it was filled with people… 
and like other reviews, the walls are very thin and after short night sleep, quite tricky to rest well.

Poor comfort and not great service,"It was five minutes from a U bahn station and wasn't very noisy.

There was no one comfortable to sit in the room and the beds were parallel to the wall with no headboard, and you couldn't sit against the wall due to a piece of wood that ran along it, so I turned over the office furniture-like table and used that as a headboard. Twice the cleaning staff walked into my room without knocking, and when I complained at reception the guy just shrugged and said they didn't expect you there"". When I asked for a do not disturb sign or for him to ask the cleaning staff to knock", the only option he gave me was not to have my room cleaned at all. When I checked in," another member of staff looked at my UK passport and said ""You are no longer an EU nation"".

386,Gerry,Ireland,Standard Queen Room,3,Couple,Dec-21,1-Feb-22,We went for a short stay from 27th / 30th December 2021 . Hotel was spotless but lacked atmosphere .,"The Hotel was very clean and comfortable . Rooms were fine and big and modern with a good size tv . As expected most tv channels were in German but there were 2 BBC channels  which was good as i am from Ireland and only speak a little German . The Food was good in the Bar when it was open .  Frankfurt NiederRad train station is approx a 20 minute walk from the Hotel so it is possible to get a train straight into Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof i.e City centre and this only takes about 5 minutes.  NiederRad station is also handy as it is on the Train line for Frankfurt Flughafen/ Airport which is only a short journey also .  There are also other trams right in front of hotel to enable travel to other places in Frankfurt .We asked for a city view room and we got one for 6 euro a night extra . Couldnt Fault the Cleanliness of the Hotel . The Room we had was nice and quiet and spotlessly clean , the beds were very comfortable with plenty room in them  .  We didnt have the Breakfast so i cant comment on that .","The hotel lacked atmosphere and seemed more suited to Business Travellers or people using the hotel for work .  We arrrived at 11am approx but we couldnt get anything to eat until after 2pm which was crazy so we went looking for a Restaurant or cafe but nothing nearby , everywhere was  closed up . The Reception area and Bar are nearly all the one place with just Shelving with ornaments on the shelves seperating the 2 areas therefore the Bar was in no way cosy . The staff in the bar however were helpful and friendly . They need to serve food when the bar is open in my opinion even just bar food would do or snacks and not just serve food  at certain times . We took a walk from the Hotel to get some food  but everywhere was closed because of the Christmas Holidays and Covid  , not that there is much happening either side of the Hotel anyway  . I cant understand everywhere being closed for the Christmas Holidays , surely this is when Hospitality should be making a fortune as it does back in Ireland at this time of year . We ended up going into Frankfurt city centre to get something to eat . We had hoped to see the Christmas Markets while we were there but these were closed due to Covid so we cant blame the Hotel for that .  There are no Pubs or Bars anywhere near the Hotel so we had to go into Frankfurt city centre every evening so the Hotel is more suited for Business Travellers in my opinion unless you dont mind getting trains or Taxis to Frankfurt City Centre which isnt too much of a problem as there is a taxi outside the Main Entrance of the Hotel at all times .",0,8,285,6/23/2022 9:46,,,,,,

744,Christopher,United States of America,Single Room with Bathroom,1,Solo traveler,Apr-22,17-Apr-22,Awful,"TLDR: sheets weren’t clean.
The name “Steps” isn’t just some cute name. There are potentially several flights of stairs to get up to your room, at least one to get to the first group of rooms. There is no elevator.
The room was incredibly cramped. The floor was some kind of wood that was covered by a cheap flat veneer that creaked with age. There was no air conditioner, other than opening the window. The small single bed I ordered took up roughly half the room.
The sheets had several hairs on them, as did the pillow case. The comforter was some kind of duvet, and both the actual pillow underneath the case, and the duvet beneath its cover felt old and soiled. I don’t know if I can explain it. It’s that heavy, oily feeling you get when you put on something that isn’t clean.
The bathroom looked old and like it had been poorly updated at some point in the past 10 years. The floor was cheep, poorly grouted tile that seemed to have some kind of water marks on it. The shower was cheap plastic and barely big enough to fit a normal-sized man in. There was mildew growing in parts of it, and a few hairs on the shower floor.
I had gone up to the room only to drop my bags off briefly when I first got there, so I didn’t notice much other than the size of the room. It was late when I got back, so I had to sleep in this since there was no staff to ask about cleaning the sheets at least. And even if there were, there was no phone in the room provided.
When I got up, I realized it was a holiday and that many places could be closed, so against my better judgement, I ordered the breakfast buffet. It was a bit sparse, but ok. At least until I ordered a croissant. The server, who seemed like a nice person don’t get me wrong, dropped the serving tongs on the floor and quickly picked them back up. She rinsed them off with water but didn’t use any soap. I asked her repeatedly to please wash them, but she couldn’t understand English, so in the end I told her never mind.",,0,1,279,6/23/2022 9:46,,,,,,

NO shampoo, NO body soup, no nothing they write  in room description. I went to ask reception girl for shampoo, she said they dont have it, and I can go by it in the Shop! Next day there was diffrent administrator and she gave me shampoo. She was much nicer.
Room sound isolation - 0. You will hear literrary everyone who will walk across the coridor and kids screaming, running till late evening, people walking at night. Someone flushing the toilet sounda etc.
I would not recommend this hostel.",0,4,278,6/23/2022 9:46,,,,,,

When i came here he wasnt there. I was even throight they just didnt clearned after some guests. I went to sleep and in the middle of the night around 02:00 am came this man, switched on the light, he spoked with himself and start walked around the room. I was scared alot. I was took all of my stuff running to repection and asked to change my room immidatly. Really u must care more about guests safety. Also u have the same keys from every boxes for private things. So Everyone can open ur box with ur stuff easily. There is no security even for private things at all.And also when I was cheaked out and waited for my next train to other city they didnt allowed to use toliet. They said they dont have it. Only in the rooms. Just u feel there not welcomed at all. Next time i will stay for sure in another hostel.",0,1,278,6/23/2022 9:46,,,,,,

It is so clean and the extra facilities of hand sanitiser and alcohol wipes was very encouraging for someone travelling during a pandemic.
The no contact breakfast was very inventive! Vegan travellers should ask for soya milk (it's the good stuff!) but definitely the vegetable spreads in tomato and paprika are delicious on the bread rolls.
The pillows were super soft and I actually really appreciated knowing that the room was cleaned and sealed. In addition I was glad that it wouldn't have to be cleaned every day unless I requested. Less waste on towels and I don't need the bed turned everyday anyway.
The location was fabulous as it was  right by the Tiergarten. Generally very easy to find in between two travel stations, plus the 109 bus to Tegel airport stops 5 minutes away from the hotel.

Modern hotel, comfortable & clean double room with a nice bath room and a water boiler to prepare tea (no mini-bar). We enjoyed that firm matraces, but some may find them a bit hard, and slept very well (relatively silent airco). To be recommended! We stayed 3 nights.","As the S-Bahn goes by straight next to one side of the hotel, sleeping with an open window is not really a option. When booking, we had asked for a room high up (and got the 6th floor :-) ) and that was ok. Further down, the noise may be bigger - despite the triple windows. Breakfast was 'contact-less' due to Covid, and therefore no buffet & limited choice. But overall ok.",0,8,290,6/23/2022 9:46,,,,,,

 -the interior of the room (its kinda old fashioned, specially the carpet)
-why is the shower dont have door ? (the water splashing on the toilet floor )
-toilet room that dont have lock
theres a bit confusion about the early check in thing. i wish for an early check in which was approved. when we are about to check in and we said we want the 2 rooms to be at the same floor . They said we need to wait til 3pm coz the rooms were not yet ready (eventhough ahead of time by booking i stated everything that we want the 2 rooms on the same floor or maybe next to its other )  and so we waited for 2 hrs for the 2 rooms to be prepared...
but its nice thou ;)

Mouldy smell in the bathroom 
Noisiest place I've ever stayed. My room was in the stairwell so I had slamming doors, people running up & down the stairs until early hrs of the morning. Everything echoed & then next to my room was the door to access all the rooms who didn't have the joy of being in the stairwell, so the door slammed everytime someone went in or out. They also had the good foresight to put me next to two rooms of teenagers on a school trip. I could hear every word in the room next door there is zero soundproofing. Reception were around when the running around and screaming (I wish I was exaggerating), sitting in the stairwell yelling to each other, it was not addressed. 
I requested a change of room out of the stairwell & was told they'd have to think about it & I should come back, I went back a few times & noone was at reception. 
Towel not supplied, you have to ask for it. 
I asked reception for guidance with the trams etc but not forthcoming at all so I just looked it up online.

So they made a re-booking, which was fine. What I didn't understand is that they kept us waiting for a long time without any drink. Since I have a confirmation of booking at my hand, it was the hotel's fault for not finding my reservation. Usually, if it's five stars hotel, the staff is well trained, and if this kind of thing happens, they apologize first and at least offer something to drink. Apology... maybe yes, but no offer nor upgrade after a long wait. I stayed at many four stars and five stars hotels in the past, and Meridien is one of my favorite chains, but this stay was very disappointing from the beginning.

Only after giving him a shrug and stare did he even bother coming to serve us at the front of the line.  The staff working the bar and restaurant were equally abysmal. We had to collect pieces of cutlery and go to the bar for service despite it being a sit-down dinner. (Let me point out we were the only guests dining in at the time too).  The service and attitude were disgusting. The only reason I didn't give a worse rating is because the breakfast staff were friendly.

The location is not bad but all depends on your personal activities","I’m sorry this is the first time I write a negative comment of my life but I’ve to be honest (I’ve pictures) for the people who will have maybe the very bad idea  to book this hotel :
when I arrived after a long walk day in the Hotel, I asked for a modern and comfortable bathroom to recover, the lady gave me the suite I booked and when I did enter in it, I immediately notice she did not care about what I told her just earlier, the room was smelling terribly bad, the carpet on the floor was in a really catastrophic state as a tank had passed over it - looks like there is mold even some was bulging , the bathroom was dirty worst there was urine traces and the toilet was not flushed, trash not empty from the previous guest, the heater system was broken, I couldn’t use the bathtub because the enamel of the bathtub was broken in pieces and hurting the skin. the towels were so hard and old…Everything in the room was broken and terribly poorly maintained, the glass of the table was broken, I couldn’t even seat on those old dirty sofa. basically I booked a suite to invite people but in these conditions I had to cancel everything.
In the bed there was an insect and lot of hairs in the sheet. it’s the first time in life I’m  even scared to look around the room in a hotel to not discover something else. I had to sleep with my clothes since I was feeling very disgusted and the mattress was old uncomfortable. The small TV was not working easily.  I could say more but I think this is enough for you to understand and I hope the hotel will do deep renovation or to degrade in terms of stars since this is definitely not what 5* customers
need.
Also when I made the booking I asked for flowers, actually they did not even call me to ask what kind of flower I like and they choose for those kind of insignificant & ugly bouquet you find in supermarket , they were full of chemical products and not even looking fresh. of course they made me paid for it.",4,1,282,6/23/2022 9:46,,,,,,

Also the fridge wasn’t plugged in, so I had to look for it, and when I look beneath the fridge, the plugger was all in dust.

S bahn and buses to Tegel airport etc.).I had Amazon packages delivered to the hotel which was great.The air conditioning worked for both heating and cooling (it heated better than it cooled, but cracking the window open did the job of cooling better eventually.)You can not have both the window opened and the air con on (for obvious reasons).Good quick elevators.","The bed was a little hard for my taste. Even though we still had a good night's sleep.You have to swipe your card to get up/down the elevator (which is understandable and even makes you feel safer. however it is a bit annoying).The bathroom has sliding glass door which doesn't block out the light / sound if one prefer's to sleep while the other showers.

Cologne is very bike friendly and flat!Getting about: Good links to U & S Ban. 20min walk to the Dom - what more could you want.If you have time, try a day out to the Dragon's Castle at Königswinter. Get the train from the central station to Königswinter and ride the cog-railway to the top. Walk back down have a drink/meal in one of the riverside bars.

I travel a lot for work and I’ve developed a thing for hotels that you remember even years after. This was my third stay in a 25hours hotel after visiting the Zurich and the Frankfurt one and I can only recommend to stay in them.
Best things:
- the whole mood and decor of the hotel, that has such a unique but homely and welcoming personality 
- the room design, its colours and comfiness 
- the free minibar with water, cola, beers and crisps and kinder choco riegel
- the duvet and the pillows
- love the portable music speaker, always use it
- the restaurant Neni was a whole experience on its own and was amazing. The view from up there is gorgeous and the staff very friendly. They accommodated me a table when they were fully booked and let me bring down my bottle of wine to my room with a wine glass from the restaurant. The food there was delicious and the menu very inspired.
- it felt very safe with Covid regulations and is really airy and spacious inside
- amazing location close to a lot of cafés and metro and not too too far (15 minutes walk) from the main train station",Nothing it was all perfect,2,10,299,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,,

As I was attending a conference nearby, it was in a good location and connected to the metro line so I was able to get around easily, both to the conference and to the centre for some exploring. It was one of the few hotels with 24-hour check-in. The pool was an added asset. The staff were all really kind and friendly. The breakfast was of a really good quality and had a lot of variety. Breakfast was also available over a long period of time, so I did not need to go down really early. Housekeeping was very discrete. The room service was great as well.","The WiFi was absolutely terrible. I would have appreciated some hair conditioner in the bathroom, as there was only a shampoo/shower gel dispenser. The pool was quite small and a strange oval shape, so if there was more than one person in the pool, it was quite awkward to swim around. If the pool was rectangular then at least people could do lengths without getting in the way of each other. I was looking forward to using the sauna, but it is the first place I have ever been which is mixed gender and actively *forbids* wearing any kind of clothing, including towels?!

Right on Kudamm close to the shopping malls and the very nice and old church.
Public transport (S-bahn - fast train) is 5 min walk, plus many buses are nearby.

The bathroom was dirty and old, rusty with old tiles, small sink with no place to put stuff. They claimed it is an old building so the toilets and bathroom are old (why would I care?? I paid for a 4 stars bathroom).
First room was facing the train rails, when the window is open it can get loud.
Due to Corona the gym and sauna were closed -  I would expect to give us a voucher to go to a near by gym - I went and did 3 free sessions in near by gyms (creative solution from a desperate guy who was counting on a gym in-house).
For the price per night I would also expect breakfast included, really, 12€ per breakfast additionally, hmm I rather go to get coffee somewhere else.
Air-conditioning was not working in our room, it only blows air, not cool air as expected.
We moved 2 times, from the old building to another room which had the same level of dirty bathroom - when we asked for compensation, they suggested either we stay there and get 10€ back per night OR move to a nicer room in the newer building (room is smaller, no balcony, facing the street) with a clean and new bathroom, we took the latter.

Not bad - just okay. It is also worth bearing in mind that this hotel is doing it's utmost to be cool"" by pumping EDM into the corridors at all times. I quite like EDM", but I can understand that this may not be to your taste. Rooms can be a little on the dark side due to the decor and dark curtains and nets - again it's quite a chilled, vibe I personally like, but may not be for everyone. I want to stress again that I love this hotel and would definitely stay again," but you should be aware of these things before you go!""",0,9.6,298,6/23/2022 9:47,,

The hotel is ABSOLUTELY sexy!,The fact that the bouncers of the lounge displayed a problem allowing us in the lounge was disappointing. However they changed their tone once we explained we were guest at the hotel. It's funny how at first they claimed to be at compasity so early in  the night ( 22:30). When we said we would just go to our room they found room for us. Once we went inside and saw all the available seats it was very disappointing.,0,9.2,298,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,,

The floors are very worn and dirty, including the grout in the bathroom tiles and floorboards in the room. The carpet in the hotel corridors was very stained.We also found the 'space theme' decor to be a bit lame, I guess this is subjective, but we would have preferred more pillows than a robot teddy on the bed.If the basics had been included we would have found it a little nicer, but for the price it just didn't live up to the expectations.",0,5,299,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,,

The bathroom was falling apart. The shower was very difficult to regulate and my kids got burned a bit by the shower water that suddenly turned extremely hot when one of us flushed the toilet. The tap water smelled really bad. The room was next to the corridor door and the lift, so people were constantly banging the corridor door despite the sign asking for considerate behaviour. In the app it showed as booked with breakfast but the staff denied us breakfast as it seems it wasn't actually booked. The safe in the rooms wasn't  working and when I asked the lady at the receipting said someone stole the keys and they deactivated all safes in the hotel. So nowhere to put your valuables. There also seemed to be a fridge in the room at some point but that got also taken out and the fridge shell is standing in the middle of the room as some sort of decoration.

4762,Austin,United States of America,Double Room,2,Couple,Aug-21,11-Aug-21,"Nice hotel in a great location, but a privacy & safety issue must be resolved","Location:The location of the hotel was excellent. It was only 10 minutes walking to the train station, cathedral and river area. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants and shopping as well, it would be hard to find a better spot for the hotel. Despite being in the middle of everything it is very quiet at night so it is easy to sleep without hearing people partying.Value:All things (with exception of the below incident) considered it was a great value at a low cost.","Safety Incident:
The reason we are not rating this hotel at a 8.5 is due to a very concerning incident that occurred during our weekend stay. We had a room that faced the back of the hotel into a courtyard surrounded by other buildings. The room was on the 3rd floor and had a fire escape staircase that went up from a lower roof (the hotel lobby) up to our room and other attached rooms. After a great night in Cologne we came back and were getting ready for bed and allowing the room to cool down by keeping the window and the door open to let the cool air in. At approximately midnight a person made their way onto the lower roof and came up our fire escape and was 1 meter from our door before I came out of the bathroom and confronted him. My girlfriend was already in bed at this time and it was clear that this man was watching her in bed, the situation could have been much worse if I did not spot this person and confront him when I did. He was very caught off guard and did not give answers to any of the questions I had regarding if he was a guest of the hotel and what room he was in, only that he was sorry he was lost"". He quickly ran back down the stairs and went around the lower roof out of view. I made a report with the police and contacted the hotel. We exchanged a few messages before the hotel stopped responding"," which was not acceptable during a situation regarding safety. The morning of checkout I gave the hotel owner a description of the man and it did not fit anyone staying at the hotel that night (hotel only has 14 rooms so it was easy to narrow down). At the very least this hotel needs to install cameras on the back side of the building viewing the lower roof and fire escape as guests privacy is easily violated and worse situations could easily arise especially for female guests. I am more than happy to edit my review once this security issue has been resolved and the hotel sends proof of cameras installed.""",1,5,300,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,

On the reception we give us a FILTERED WATER (not mineral!) for free. We was happy.
Then we come back to the hotel at 11:30pm.
We call the reception to have more water.
They told us they didn't do room service.
OK, my wife go to the reception with PAJAMAS (there was full of people doing check-in, she was embarrassed).
She ask for the water. NOT MINERAL. JUST FILTERED WATER FROM THE FAUCED.
The guy at the reception give her the water and asked her 5 EUROS.
She replied that during the afternoon what TAP WATER was for free and she was in pajamas and with NO MONEY.
She asked also to give the money the day after.
The guy replied: NO MONEY NO WATER.
She come back to the room with no water.
This is the WORST experience for a customer!! No service room, no trust to your customer (PLATINUM AMERICAN EXPRESS CUSTOMER) and you reply to my wife IN PAJAMAS to COME BACK TO THE ROOM TO TAKE THE MONEY AT MIDNIGHT????

5243,Ekaterina,Russia,Superior Room,3,Couple,Sep-19,21-Sep-19,Poor,"So, we decided to spend 3 nights at this hotel. Actually, the pictures are great, but the reality is different and the devil is in details. Lets focus on the things not mentioned anywhere:1. Check-in. Of course, its more or less standard, but the guys require eur100 per night per room to block on the card in case its credit one, eur200 per night in case its debit one. You just lock between 300 to 600 euros liquidity for 3 nights. Thats not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that the receptionist cannot find any compromise at all! She is just not capable of it (or not eligible). So, just be prepared to lock this amount.2. Location FROM HOTEL: thank you for took the time to provide us your feedback. We are very sorry that you had such a unpleasant stay with us. At all Check-in process we block an amount of room price + 100EUR per night. But we do not charge it, this block is only for guarantee caused of our high-quality minibar. It is standard in a lot of hotels exactly like you said.Our Location is close to the main station of Frankfurt and only 10 minutes away from the downtown. So Frankfurt is a lively city there are a lot of people and different culture close together. We are feeling blue that you do not liked our bar. our bar is known of their drinks and cocktails and we are awarded as the best hotelbar in germany. That is the reason why so many people visit our bar and want to celebrate with us. So maybe next time you try one of our special drinks. The Point with the pillow is a great pity because if you asked we will bring you different pillows to enjoy your sleep how you prefer it. We are definitly not a normal 5 star hotel, our hotel concept is very extravagant and special. The design based on burlesque elegance and lascivious lifestyle. We also have our one scent concept in the whole hotel. of course our Philosophy is a matter of taste. We would recommend you The Pure in Frankfurt!","Dear Roomers management!
First of all, thank you for the reply. However, it does not provide any answers. Moreover, sometimes you provide misleading information in your answer and/or the information, which does not correspond the personal experience i had. Point by point.
1. My personal case is that the blocked eur100 still not returned to the card, despite i left the hotel on 15th of Sept and today is 20th. And the question is not about blocking, rather anout the time of return!
2. Yes, I agree that Bahnhofsviertel is not the best location and I knew it. However, you cannot say its clean around. It is just dirty! Very dirty! Comparing to many other locations in the same city. Not your fault, but people just have to take it for granted.
3. The Bar. I did not say anything bad about your coctails. I mentioned ESPRESSO and FRESH ORANGE JUICE. Espresso is from capsules and juice - from vig bottles. Espresso is not what it should be with a fancy bar, and juice is not fresh, its packaged with sugar. Don't you agree??? A bar is not just coctails. Its about QUALITY. Any skillful barman can make lots of coctails from good ingredients. But overall quality is about NOT USING CAPSULES at least and buying fancy coffe machine!
4. Pillows. Indeed, it is said one can ask for a different pillow. We asked! And you said YOU DID NOT HAVE ANY DIFFERENT! It is personal experience, not fiction. Looks like your statement about 'pillow bar'is a fantasy. You just brought us same pillows - flat mess of textiles. Good you had them... it helped a little.
5. The SMELL. There's CIGARETTE SMELL EVERYWHERE. Thank you for not denying it.
So, in general the 'bourlesqueness' and 'lasciviousness' you mention definately were planned... but they are... 'not-more-than-medim-class'... comparing to, for example, Sofitel in Munich, which ia also near Hauptbahnhof by the way and is really a great example of a truly fancy and stylish hotel.",0,3.3,298,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,,

Let's start with the location. The location of the hotel cannot be more perfect that what it is! It is in the heart of Berlin, directly in the middle of Savignyplatz and Ku'Damm. This is one of the elite and sophisticated area of Berlin and to live here is a big thing. The rooms are quite big. Also, not to mention the S-Bahn track is directly next to the hotel, you barely hear any noise from there. There was no disturbance at all. The buffet breakfast of the hotel was also quite amazing with a lot of varieties even for the vegetarian ones. I was here for 6 days and the breakfast was changing everyday which I quite liked. The beds were quite comfortable and also a Nespresso machine in the room with free Nespresso capsules everyday. The staff was helpful and one can easily park on the street for a nominal amount. They also have their own parking facility at a certain daily fee of approx. 20€.","The hotel boasted of a lot of facilities for which i chose this particular hotel but unfortunately all of them were closed due to COVID-19 of course. I can't blame the hotel for this. But one thing which I honestly think the hotel needs to improve on is the weird pathway to the hotel rooms via the garage. The problem is not that one cannot find the rooms but the lift present there confuses a lot of guests, I being one of them. I tried to use this lift which was very very dirty, and found out only later that this lift was to be used by the staff to bring garbage and the original lift for guests was still further inside the hotel. Lack of signs made it confusing. This could be improved!!",0,8,292,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,,

Cleaning staff were lovely and did a great job of keeping the common areas and the rooms spotless. Reception was always well-staffed and I never had to wait long.,"The air conditioning in my room (and I expect all rooms) is not fit for purpose. I complained that it wasn't working and was basically told that it is working fine and if I'm warm, I should just open a window. This was not a satisfactory response as it is quite loud outside and the open window did little to cool the room. I requested a technician to check the air conditioning in the room on two separate occasions but they never came. Basically, if you like a cold room when you sleep, avoid staying here. To be honest, it's a bit of a joke for a 4-star hotel.",0,5,292,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,,

After checking in, the receptionist said we have to wait 20 mins as the room was not ready. We were handed with the room key at 3:30PM. The room was okay from the look but very hot inside. The AC obviously didn't work as we realized the same in the public area. We kept our bags in the room and left for business meeting. We came back at 10PM and realized that the AC hasn't been working since we left and the room was very very hot. We went down to the reception to inform them about the issue. Nils - who claimed to be the manager at the time told us that they didn't have any technician to fix this and there is nothing they can do (already showed unwillingness to help). We insisted as it is impossible to sleep under that temperature. After some time, he offered us another room - 529. We took the key and went upstairs to check, the room was not cleaned. Glasses, bed, towels from previous guests were lying everywhere and full of water. We went down and told him we cannot take that room. He shook his head and said there is nothing he can do as the hotel is full. He is not willing to refund either. We checked out and left the hotel at 11:30PM to go to another one. On another note, there was sign at the reception saying masks are required inside the hotel. Where everyone else from the afternoon shift were wearing mask. Nils (who said he is the manager) was not wearing one. Worst attitude ever!",2,1,292,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,,

The steak was tender and juicy, definitely worth what I'd paid for, and the baked potato was really delicious. Great comfort food. Overall, a thumbs up to the food"" in general",,,,,,,,,,,
The room (Beds) were comfortable. I wish there were a thicker blanket, but I did come from a tropical-subtropical area, so it is highly likely that the Europeans find the temperature fine. I mean, it was not cold, but I'd like it warm. And because it was generally acceptable, I did not ask the staff for a thicker blanket, and it is likely that they might be able to supply them. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, overall," a good hotel with helpful staff and a generally good position. Breakfast and metro nearby with a few minutes walk. I didn't explore the area too much to be giving a good opinion on this.""","The overall design of the shower was TERRIBLE. (I lived in a room for two, if you were wondering)It was not the hotel's fault, and to be honest, it didn't affect me a lot. But they had this useless piece of glass panel with a hinge connecting a fixed and functional glass panel that was supposed to keep the water out. And between the two panels, were this slit that water kept pouring out onto the floor. I was not TOO annoyed since it wasn't me that had to clean the floor, but I had to watch my steps to avoid soggy slippers. Okay to acceptable in a hotel, but I'd ask for a full refund from the designer if it were my place. Tried everything to stop the floor from getting wet but in vain.The cocktail. I was not much of a drinker, so I will not be going with the tastes. I first found two fruit fly like creature in the cocktail a few moments after I ordered it. I was not sure if they decided to join the party after I started eating, maybe jumped into the pool when I was digging into my steak. I asked the bartender to kindly pick them from the cocktail, which he kindly did, and I continued drinking. I was not able to finish the drink and asked to take them back to my room (No additional fruit flies seen above the ice cubes at this time), but after I emptied the drinks, I noticed three additional fruit flies (which I was sure that there isn't any in my room) lay in the bottom of the glass. I did not immediately count five fruit flies when the drink was served, so there might be this chance that the flies drowned themselves while I was not aware of it, but I think it is more likely that they were buried under the ice when the drinks were made.

You pay 12 euro's a day for the car park, but the hotel does not note your license plate, so has no way of telling if a car is supposed to be there or not.

However Giulia, the Italian receptionist, was super prompt on sorting these issues out and she make it up for everything by changing my room on spot. It is always nice to be recognised as a loyal customer and receive a good service. In fact I go to Frankfurt on a monthly basis and always staying here.

Good air-conditioning coupled with blackout curtains that work & a good bed made for a good night's rest. Breakfast was a zoo at feeding time but the staff were on task & opened up additional seating areas & replenished foods as required. My dinner was exceptional & the SA waiter fabulous.,Getting to the hotel is a true test of navigation - I failed on my first pass. The amount of construction in the area beggars belief & defies any navigation system. The next test was check-in - only one person actually doing any work while another seemed to be distracted on other tasks. 30 mins to check in 3 people. The same lack of personnel was the order of the day on check-out. Why? By far my greatest worry was trying to get hold of reception to alert them of a major disturbance coming from a nearby room - the line would transfer to the main IHG reservations line after a number of rings. It took until 2am to finally alert the staff of the ongoing fight.,0,8,285,6/23/2022 9:47,,,,,,
