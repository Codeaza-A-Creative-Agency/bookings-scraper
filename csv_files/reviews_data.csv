","A great hotel with excellent staff","A very good hotel with exceptional staff! We noticed majority of staff having excellent English conversational skills. We were 4 adults with 1 kid. AC was dysfunctional in one of our 2 booked rooms. Anastasia, from the reception promptly solved this by offering us alternate room. And she even levied off parking fees. Cleanliness is very much taken care in the hotel during these difficult times. Interiors are bit dated but are clean and maintained. Full breakfast was served even though most other hotels were having reduced breakfast facilities. Emin, the staff associate at food counter was very polite, attentive and charming. Hotel is easily reachable by train and car, quite near to highway entry/exit. Hotel provides covered parking; free parking outside on street is available although it can be difficult to find during business hours. Niederrad bahnhof is within walking distance from hotel. It is just next to Aldi Süd, about 400 meters from hotel. Overall we are very satisfied and would like to come to this hotel again. Finally, do not forget to enjoy curry food at the Indian restaurant within walking distance.",,0,10,250,"2022-06-14 19:51:25"

","A whirlwind trip around an interesting city","Once I found it and they explained the uBahn(underground) and bus options I managed OK. At least there was a lift to all floors.  View from room was a airplane spotters dream! Else same as other single rooms with ensuite loo n shower n basin. Breakfast offered but I had not booked as not much time for it","Place was awkward to find by bus from airport and then lugging heavy suitcases too (which I had tried to leave in left luggage but their system was down so I had to lug it around Berlin for 24 hrs then it got left somewhere as it didn't arrive with the plane... (Grr grr grr) and still not found 4 days later (but that's not the hotel fault)",0,6.7,257,"2022-06-14 19:51:26"

","My personal summary is that I will probably not stay at a Good Morning Hotel again.  Sorry","Some of the staff were very nice, I'll leave the rest to your imagination.  It's very convenient to Tegel Airport.  There are a couple coffee bars just out and around the corner from the hotel as well as a good grocery store.","Every one of their adds emphasize the breakfast.  Turned out with our reservation it wasn't included. Might have been our fault, but, as we were grabbing a cab just as breakfast opened we had a cup of coffee and a minimal breakfast (sausage and a dollop of scrambled eggs) for JUST 9 Euros extra.  If you go in and think, oh, there's a vending machine here and I can get water, a beer or whatever, make sure it's working.  I walked over to the grocery and got some things and planned to grab a water back at the hotel.  But no...and again possibly my fault, all the signs on the machine were in German...my bad.It was 30 degrees...no AC.",0,5.8,257,"2022-06-14 19:51:26"

During the check in our receptionist noticed it was my boyfriends birthday the next day, so she gave us a coupon for 2 prosecco's which we thought was very thoughtful of her. The room with the bath tub was really nice and the bed was very comfortable. It's perfect for couples. During the check out everyone remembered the birthday of my boyfriend and wished him a happy birthday.The service and the thoughtfullness of the staff goes beyond.

When i came here he wasnt there. I was even throight they just didnt clearned after some guests. I went to sleep and in the middle of the night around 02:00 am came this man, switched on the light, he spoked with himself and start walked around the room. I was scared alot. I was took all of my stuff running to repection and asked to change my room immidatly. Really u must care more about guests safety. Also u have the same keys from every boxes for private things. So Everyone can open ur box with ur stuff easily. There is no security even for private things at all.And also when I was cheaked out and waited for my next train to other city they didnt allowed to use toliet. They said they dont have it.

","Not again.","Great location in Charlottenburg sector. Underground private parking.","Ok, this is the third time I’ve stayed in this hotel and I’ve decided it’s the last. The pillows on the bed are terrible, no support whatsoever. You fall right thru them. Front desk staff suggested I combine two together. Was a bit better but didn’t really solve the problem. Mattress is very firm and queen size standard bed too small if you are 6,67 ft. The room doesn’t have any cabinets with drawers so if you stay for a longer time, like I did, you have to partially live out of your suitcase. The carpeting in the hall on the first floor is filthy and smells. The breakfast is ok.

","Hampton Hotel by Hilton Berlin City West, Berlin, Germany","I very much enjoyed staying in this hotel, similar to the Hampton Hotels in the USA, but with a better buffet type breakfast in Germany. The hotel looks new, even though it has been there for several years now. Very convenient to Kufürstendamm, near the Uhlandstrasse U-Bahn Station, easily accesible to the Airport Bus to Tegel Airport.  Nice rooms, big bed, comfortable, nice TV with ample international channels, and mostly quiet (except for one side which is very near the train tracks, but did not bother me).  Air conditioning worked very well.  The night receptionist Temeu (pronunced like Timo) was very helpful and a pleasure to speak with upon arrival, very patient as well.  This hotel is recommendable, as the price was reasonable for Berlin.  Excellent breakfast.","The only things that could have helped are a small fridge in the room.  I had a quiet room facing the back of the hotel, but the train tracks run on an elevated platform very close to the hotel on the other side. I assume that the insulation is very good on that side of the hotel, but not sure if you can hear the noise there. I was very satisfied with the hotel. Very nice.",0,9.2,255,"2022-06-14 19:51:27"

4. the housekeeping cleaned our room and changed our towels and sheets every day 🤗.","1. our window was facing a business building which was very close to the window.
so we closed our curtains because we didn’t had any privacy.
2. because the problem I wrote above- the curtains was always closed and we realized that there isn’t so much light in the room.

","Perfect location, delicious breakfast and comfortable rooms.","This was the first time I tried NH Group hotels and to be honest I was not disappointed. Let's start with the location. The location of the hotel cannot be more perfect that what it is! It is in the heart of Berlin, directly in the middle of Savignyplatz and Ku'Damm. This is one of the elite and sophisticated area of Berlin and to live here is a big thing. The rooms are quite big. Also, not to mention the S-Bahn track is directly next to the hotel, you barely hear any noise from there. There was no disturbance at all. The buffet breakfast of the hotel was also quite amazing with a lot of varieties even for the vegetarian ones. I was here for 6 days and the breakfast was changing everyday which I quite liked. The beds were quite comfortable and also a Nespresso machine in the room with free Nespresso capsules everyday. The staff was helpful and one can easily park on the street for a nominal amount. They also have their own parking facility at a certain daily fee of approx. 20€.","The hotel boasted of a lot of facilities for which i chose this particular hotel but unfortunately all of them were closed due to COVID-19 of course. I can't blame the hotel for this. But one thing which I honestly think the hotel needs to improve on is the weird pathway to the hotel rooms via the garage. The problem is not that one cannot find the rooms but the lift present there confuses a lot of guests, I being one of them. I tried to use this lift which was very very dirty, and found out only later that this lift was to be used by the staff to bring garbage and the original lift for guests was still further inside the hotel. Lack of signs made it confusing. This could be improved!!",0,8,260,"2022-06-14 19:51:28"

","Central, modern hotel near Kudamm","Modern rooms/facilities, very comfortable beds, coffee/tea makings in the room. Very quiet and with lifts & real Air Conditioning (it was really hot outside & got nice & cool in our room). Good breakfast buffet with outdoor seating during warmer weather. The hotel is well situated near the Kudamm and not far from the Tiergarten - so you could catch the hop-on-hop-off buses c. 10 min walk away. The U1 is also right around the corner & other public transport (buses) are near. There is a parking garage for EUR 19/day and on-street parking (pay until 10 pm & free on Sundays). Free parking is available, but not right there in that neighborhood. Very nice staff at front desk and we were able to check-in early as our room was ready - which we appreciated! Definitely would recommend!","Parking is pricy. If you’re here privately with a car - and not on a Sunday, it’s not the best area for parking. However, you can find free parking not super far away. Without a car (of if you’re using your car during the day), it’s perfect!
