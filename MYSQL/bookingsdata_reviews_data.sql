Let\'s start with the location. The location of the hotel cannot be more perfect that what it is! It is in the heart of Berlin, directly in the middle of Savignyplatz and Ku\'Damm. This is one of the elite and sophisticated area of Berlin and to live here is a big thing. The rooms are quite big. Also, not to mention the S-Bahn track is directly next to the hotel, you barely hear any noise from there. There was no disturbance at all. The buffet breakfast of the hotel was also quite amazing with a lot of varieties even for the vegetarian ones. I was here for 6 days and the breakfast was changing everyday which I quite liked. The beds were quite comfortable and also a Nespresso machine in the room with free Nespresso capsules everyday. The staff was helpful and one can easily park on the street for a nominal amount. They also have their own parking facility at a certain daily fee of approx. 20€.','The hotel boasted of a lot of facilities for which i chose this particular hotel but unfortunately all of them were closed due to COVID-19 of course. I can\'t blame the hotel for this. But one thing which I honestly think the hotel needs to improve on is the weird pathway to the hotel rooms via the garage. The problem is not that one cannot find the rooms but the lift present there confuses a lot of guests, I being one of them. I tried to use this lift which was very very dirty, and found out only later that this lift was to be used by the staff to bring garbage and the original lift for guests was still further inside the hotel. Lack of signs made it confusing.

Hotel was spotless but lacked atmosphere .','The Hotel was very clean and comfortable . Rooms were fine and big and modern with a good size tv . As expected most tv channels were in German but there were 2 BBC channels  which was good as i am from Ireland and only speak a little German .\r The Food was good in the Bar when it was open .  Frankfurt NiederRad train station is approx a 20 minute walk from the Hotel so it is possible to get a train straight into Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof i.e City centre and this only takes about 5 minutes.  NiederRad station is also handy as it is on the Train line for Frankfurt Flughafen/ Airport which is only a short journey also .  There are also other trams right in front of hotel to enable travel to other places in Frankfurt .We asked for a city view room and we got one for 6 euro a night extra . Couldnt Fault the Cleanliness of the Hotel . The Room we had was nice and quiet and spotlessly clean , the beds were very comfortable with plenty room in them  .  We didnt have the Breakfast so i cant comment on that .','The hotel lacked atmosphere and seemed more suited to Business Travellers or people using the hotel for work .  We arrrived at 11am approx but we couldnt get anything to eat until after 2pm which was crazy so we went looking for a Restaurant or cafe but nothing nearby , everywhere was  closed up . \rThe Reception area and Bar are nearly all the one place with just Shelving with ornaments on the shelves seperating the 2 areas therefore the Bar was in no way cosy . The staff in the bar however were helpful and friendly . They need to serve food when the bar is open in my opinion even just bar food would do or snacks and not just serve food  at certain times . We took a walk from the Hotel to get some food  but everywhere was closed because of the Christmas Holidays and Covid  , not that there is much happening either side of the Hotel anyway  . I cant understand everywhere being closed for the Christmas Holidays , surely this is when Hospitality should be making a fortune as it does back in Ireland at this time of year .\r We ended up going into Frankfurt city centre to get something to eat . We had hoped to see the Christmas Markets while we were there but these were closed due to Covid so we cant blame the Hotel for that .  There are no Pubs or Bars anywhere near the Hotel so we had to go into Frankfurt city centre every evening so the Hotel is more suited for Business Travellers in my opinion unless you dont mind getting trains or Taxis to Frankfurt City Centre which isnt too much of a problem as there is a taxi outside the Main Entrance of the Hotel at all times .',0,8,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:21'),(2577,9,'Joseph','Malta','Standard Queen Room','3','January 2022','Group','\n January 27, 2022\n','Good','Very good breakfast','Yes',0,7,'Dear Joseph,\nThank you for your recent booking at our Crown…','2022-06-10 16:48:21'),(2578,9,'Birgit','Germany','Standard Queen Room','3','January 2022','Solo traveler','\n January 26, 2022\n','Pleasant','Location was great- walking distance to train station.\rBed was very comfy with pillows of different strengths','Hotel is a bit tired overall.

There are potentially several flights of stairs to get up to your room, at least one to get to the first group of rooms. There is no elevator.\nThe room was incredibly cramped. The floor was some kind of wood that was covered by a cheap flat veneer that creaked with age. There was no air conditioner, other than opening the window. The small single bed I ordered took up roughly half the room.\nThe sheets had several hairs on them, as did the pillow case. The comforter was some kind of duvet, and both the actual pillow underneath the case, and the duvet beneath its cover felt old and soiled. I don’t know if I can explain it. It’s that heavy, oily feeling you get when you put on something that isn’t clean.\nThe bathroom looked old and like it had been poorly updated at some point in the past 10 years. The floor was cheep, poorly grouted tile that seemed to have some kind of water marks on it. The shower was cheap plastic and barely big enough to fit a normal-sized man in. There was mildew growing in parts of it, and a few hairs on the shower floor.\nI had gone up to the room only to drop my bags off briefly when I first got there, so I didn’t notice much other than the size of the room. It was late when I got back, so I had to sleep in this since there was no staff to ask about cleaning the sheets at least. And even if there were, there was no phone in the room provided.\nWhen I got up, I realized it was a holiday and that many places could be closed, so against my better judgement, I ordered the breakfast buffet. It was a bit sparse, but ok. At least until I ordered a croissant. The server, who seemed like a nice person don’t get me wrong, dropped the serving tongs on the floor and quickly picked them back up. She rinsed them off with water but didn’t use any soap. I asked her repeatedly to please wash them, but she couldn’t understand English, so in the end I told her never mind.','',0,1,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:26'),(3783,15,'Helen','Australia','Twin Room with Shared Bathroom','3','April 2022','Couple','\n April 14, 2022\n','Very Good','','',0,8,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:26'),(3784,15,'Nicholas','Germany','Single Room with Bathroom','2','April 2022','Solo traveler','\n April 11, 2022\n','Overall a great place and fantastic value','I liked the price of the room, cleanliness, and the breakfast provides.','No elevator and is easy to hear people coming back drunk at night.',0,9,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:26'),(3785,15,'Ruan','South Africa','Twin Room with Shared Bathroom','2','April 2022','Family','\n April 7, 2022\n','Very Good','','',0,8,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:26'),(3786,15,'Rehab','Germany','Apartment with Bathroom','1','April 2022','Family','\n April 5, 2022\n','Exceptional','','',0,10,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:26'),(3787,15,'Dorian','Germany','Single Room with Bathroom','1','April 2022','Solo traveler','\n April 3, 2022\n','Exceptional','','',0,10,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:26'),(3788,15,'Ariful','Ireland','Single Room with Bathroom','1','March 2022','Solo traveler','\n March 28, 2022\n','Wonderful','Very good service','',0,9,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:26'),(3789,15,'Ary007','Germany','Single Room with Bathroom','2','March 2022','Group','\n March 28, 2022\n','Good value for money stay','The place was just as described. no surprises, Value for money, and great reception staff.

When I asked for a do not disturb sign or for him to ask the cleaning staff to knock, the only option he gave me was not to have my room cleaned at all.

Actually, the pictures are great, but the reality is different and the devil is in details. Lets focus on the things not mentioned anywhere:\r1. Check-in. Of course, its more or less standard, but the guys require eur100 per night per room to block on the card in case its credit one, eur200 per night in case its debit one. You just lock between 300 to 600 euros liquidity for 3 nights. Thats not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that the receptionist cannot find any compromise at all! She is just not capable of it (or not eligible). So, just be prepared to lock this amount.\r2. Location \rFROM HOTEL: thank you for took the time to provide us your feedback. We are very sorry that you had such a unpleasant stay with us. \rAt all Check-in process we block an amount of room price + 100EUR per night. But we do not charge it, this block is only for guarantee caused of our high-quality minibar. It is standard in a lot of hotels exactly like you said.\rOur Location is close to the main station of Frankfurt and only 10 minutes away from the downtown. So Frankfurt is a lively city there are a lot of people and different culture close together. \rWe are feeling blue that you do not liked our bar. our bar is known of their drinks and cocktails and we are awarded as the best hotelbar in germany. That is the reason why so many people visit our bar and want to celebrate with us. So maybe next time you try one of our special drinks. \rThe Point with the pillow is a great pity because if you asked we will bring you different pillows to enjoy your sleep how you prefer it. \rWe are definitly not a normal 5 star hotel, our hotel concept is very extravagant and special. The design based on burlesque elegance and lascivious lifestyle. We also have our one scent concept in the whole hotel. of course our Philosophy is a matter of taste. We would recommend you The Pure in Frankfurt!','Dear Roomers management!\nFirst of all, thank you for the reply. However, it does not provide any answers. Moreover, sometimes you provide misleading information in your answer and/or the information, which does not correspond the personal experience i had. Point by point.\n1. My personal case is that the blocked eur100 still not returned to the card, despite i left the hotel on 15th of Sept and today is 20th. And the question is not about blocking, rather anout the time of return!\n2. Yes, I agree that Bahnhofsviertel is not the best location and I knew it. However, you cannot say its clean around. It is just dirty! Very dirty! Comparing to many other locations in the same city. Not your fault, but people just have to take it for granted.\n3. The Bar. I did not say anything bad about your coctails. I mentioned ESPRESSO and FRESH ORANGE JUICE. Espresso is from capsules and juice - from vig bottles. Espresso is not what it should be with a fancy bar, and juice is not fresh, its packaged with sugar. Don\'t you agree??? A bar is not just coctails. Its about QUALITY. Any skillful barman can make lots of coctails from good ingredients. But overall quality is about NOT USING CAPSULES at least and buying fancy coffe machine!\n4. Pillows. Indeed, it is said one can ask for a different pillow. We asked! And you said YOU DID NOT HAVE ANY DIFFERENT! It is personal experience, not fiction. Looks like your statement about \'pillow bar\'is a fantasy. You just brought us same pillows - flat mess of textiles. Good you had them... it helped a little.\n5. The SMELL. There\'s CIGARETTE SMELL EVERYWHERE. Thank you for not denying it.\nSo, in general the \'bourlesqueness\' and \'lasciviousness\' you mention definately were planned... but they are... \'not-more-than-medim-class\'... comparing to, for example, Sofitel in Munich, which ia also near Hauptbahnhof by the way and is really a great example of a truly fancy and stylish hotel.',0,3.3,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:34'),(5516,32,'Ahikam','Israel','Superior Room','1','September 2019','Solo traveler','\n September 18, 2019\n','Wonderful','','',0,9.2,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:34'),(5517,32,'Paega','Thailand','Superior Room','2','August 2019','Couple','\n September 13, 2019\n','Exceptional','Location.

It is located fairly centrally in the city, but just outside of the most premium locations, so unless you have a room on the top floors, the view from your room won\'t be anything special. Not bad - just okay. It is also worth bearing in mind that this hotel is doing it\'s utmost to be \"cool\" by pumping EDM into the corridors at all times. I quite like EDM, but I can understand that this may not be to your taste. Rooms can be a little on the dark side due to the decor and dark curtains and nets - again it\'s quite a chilled, vibe I personally like, but may not be for everyone.

We came back at 10PM and realized that the AC hasn\'t been working since we left and the room was very very hot. We went down to the reception to inform them about the issue. Nils - who claimed to be the manager at the time told us that they didn\'t have any technician to fix this and there is nothing they can do (already showed unwillingness to help). We insisted as it is impossible to sleep under that temperature. After some time, he offered us another room - 529. We took the key and went upstairs to check, the room was not cleaned. Glasses, bed, towels from previous guests were lying everywhere and full of water. We went down and told him we cannot take that room. He shook his head and said there is nothing he can do as the hotel is full. He is not willing to refund either. We checked out and left the hotel at 11:30PM to go to another one. \rOn another note, there was sign at the reception saying masks are required inside the hotel.

I can understand its corona but the hostel must take care more of safety of guests. When i came i booked a common room and they gaved me room with some alcoholic man who looked homeless and  there was no any stuff with him exept empty bottles from alcohol. When i came here he wasnt there. I was even throight they just didnt clearned after some guests. I went to sleep and in the middle of the night around 02:00 am came this man, switched on the light, he spoked with himself and start walked around the room. I was scared alot. I was took all of my stuff running to repection and asked to change my room immidatly. Really u must care more about guests safety. Also u have the same keys from every boxes for private things. So Everyone can open ur box with ur stuff easily. There is no security even for private things at all.\rAnd also when I was cheaked out and waited for my next train to other city they didnt allowed to use toliet. They said they dont have it. Only in the rooms. Just u feel there not welcomed at all.

I arrived at reception and asked a member of staff where the parking lot was, he told me very blunty that it was full, and that we\'d have to park in the garage opposite which costed 20 euros per day. The garage was esentially a building site and didn\'t feel like the best place to leave ones car. Again, not the hotels fault, it just seemed like the staff there really couldn\'t have cared less that we just drove for seven hours and had to lug up our luggage from a garage.\r-The aircon system wasn\'t great, with only one button on the whole interface, so it wasn\'t clear at all how it turn it on, turn it off, change the settings, or control the temperature. I called reception to ask for help with this (as the aircon was not staying on) and I was told something like \"have you tried to do this/that/the other?\" I said yes, that it still wasn\'t working, and they seemed reluctant to come and assist.\r-I hate that there were items in the room that the hotel was trying to sell to you, such as bags and speakers and such.

I had to sleep with my clothes since I was feeling very disgusted and the mattress was old uncomfortable. The small TV was not working easily.  I could say more but I think this is enough for you to understand and I hope the hotel will do deep renovation or to degrade in terms of stars since this is definitely not what 5* customers\nneed.\nAlso when I made the booking I asked for flowers, actually they did not even call me to ask what kind of flower I like and they choose for those kind of insignificant & ugly bouquet you find in supermarket , they were full of chemical products and not even looking fresh. of course they made me paid for it.',4,1,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8105,24,'Isabella','Brazil','Premium Room','6','November 2021','Couple','\n December 2, 2021\n','Amazing location, great breakfast but the room could be much better and comfortable.','The breakfast and the location are the main qualities.','The bed was very uncomfortable and we could not control the heat - the room was too hot.',0,7,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8106,24,'Dylan','Ireland','Family Room','3','November 2021','Couple','\n November 30, 2021\n','was given an empty room once first checked in which was not the room that was originally booked then had to pay for an u','so central to the shopping district','older outdated rooms',0,8,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8107,24,'Cathrine','Norway','Premium Room','3','November 2021','Family','\n November 28, 2021\n','Pleasant','','',0,6,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8108,24,'Adrians','Sweden','Junior Suite','1','October 2021','Couple','\n November 28, 2021\n','Good','','',0,7,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8109,24,'Vincenzo','Italy','Economy Room','4','November 2021','Solo traveler','\n November 26, 2021\n','Good','','',0,7,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8110,24,'Almotiri','Saudi Arabia','Economy Room','2','November 2021','Couple','\n November 26, 2021\n','Pleasant','the hotel is old and the service not like 5 stars','',0,6,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8111,24,'Bozidar','Serbia','Executive Room','3','November 2021','Family','\n November 25, 2021\n','Very Good','','',0,8,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8112,24,'Natalia','Germany','Economy Room','2','October 2021','Group','\n November 25, 2021\n','Pleasant','','',0,6,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8113,24,'Bosko','Serbia','Economy Room','2','November 2021','Solo traveler','\n November 25, 2021\n','Wonderful','','',0,9,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8114,24,'Matthieu','France','Economy Room','1','November 2021','Solo traveler','\n November 24, 2021\n','Wonderful','','',0,9,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8115,24,'Eran','Germany','Premium Room','4','November 2021','Family','\n November 23, 2021\n','Very Good','','',0,8,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8116,24,'George','Greece','Premium Room','3','November 2021','Group','\n November 23, 2021\n','Very Good','','',0,8,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8117,24,'Mariya','France','Economy Room','2','November 2021','Group','\n November 22, 2021\n','Very Good','it’s quite accessible and it’s clean','it’s very old',0,8,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8118,24,'Stefan','Switzerland','Premium Room','2','October 2021','Couple','\n November 22, 2021\n',NULL,'This review is hidden because it doesn\'t meet our guidelines.','',0,4,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:45'),(8119,24,'Catherine','France','Economy Room','1','November 2021','Couple','\n November 22, 2021\n','Comfortable and clean with a great location.','Great customer service and comfortable rooms.

But I guess it\'s a problem with Cologne and not here in particular','I didn\'t try out the breakfast, but the dinner was pretty good (excluding the cocktail, which I\'ll get to in a minute). The steak was tender and juicy, definitely worth what I\'d paid for, and the baked potato was really delicious. Great comfort food. Overall, a thumbs up to the \"food\" in general\rThe room (Beds) were comfortable. I wish there were a thicker blanket, but I did come from a tropical-subtropical area, so it is highly likely that the Europeans find the temperature fine. I mean, it was not cold, but I\'d like it warm. And because it was generally acceptable, I did not ask the staff for a thicker blanket, and it is likely that they might be able to supply them. \rSo, overall, a good hotel with helpful staff and a generally good position. Breakfast and metro nearby with a few minutes walk. I didn\'t explore the area too much to be giving a good opinion on this.','The overall design of the shower was TERRIBLE. (I lived in a room for two, if you were wondering)\rIt was not the hotel\'s fault, and to be honest, it didn\'t affect me a lot. But they had this useless piece of glass panel with a hinge connecting a fixed and functional glass panel that was supposed to keep the water out. And between the two panels, were this slit that water kept pouring out onto the floor. I was not TOO annoyed since it wasn\'t me that had to clean the floor, but I had to watch my steps to avoid soggy slippers. Okay to acceptable in a hotel, but I\'d ask for a full refund from the designer if it were my place. Tried everything to stop the floor from getting wet but in vain.\rThe cocktail. I was not much of a drinker, so I will not be going with the tastes. I first found two fruit fly like creature in the cocktail a few moments after I ordered it. I was not sure if they decided to join the party after I started eating, maybe jumped into the pool when I was digging into my steak. I asked the bartender to kindly pick them from the cocktail, which he kindly did, and I continued drinking. I was not able to finish the drink and asked to take them back to my room (No additional fruit flies seen above the ice cubes at this time), but after I emptied the drinks, I noticed three additional fruit flies (which I was sure that there isn\'t any in my room) lay in the bottom of the glass. I did not immediately count five fruit flies when the drink was served, so there might be this chance that the flies drowned themselves while I was not aware of it, but I think it is more likely that they were buried under the ice when the drinks were made.

It was only 10 minutes walking to the train station, cathedral and river area. The hotel is surrounded by great restaurants and shopping as well, it would be hard to find a better spot for the hotel. Despite being in the middle of everything it is very quiet at night so it is easy to sleep without hearing people partying.\rValue:\rAll things (with exception of the below incident) considered it was a great value at a low cost.','Safety Incident:\nThe reason we are not rating this hotel at a 8.5 is due to a very concerning incident that occurred during our weekend stay. We had a room that faced the back of the hotel into a courtyard surrounded by other buildings. The room was on the 3rd floor and had a fire escape staircase that went up from a lower roof (the hotel lobby) up to our room and other attached rooms. After a great night in Cologne we came back and were getting ready for bed and allowing the room to cool down by keeping the window and the door open to let the cool air in. At approximately midnight a person made their way onto the lower roof and came up our fire escape and was 1 meter from our door before I came out of the bathroom and confronted him. My girlfriend was already in bed at this time and it was clear that this man was watching her in bed, the situation could have been much worse if I did not spot this person and confront him when I did. He was very caught off guard and did not give answers to any of the questions I had regarding if he was a guest of the hotel and what room he was in, only that he was sorry he was \"lost\". He quickly ran back down the stairs and went around the lower roof out of view. I made a report with the police and contacted the hotel. We exchanged a few messages before the hotel stopped responding, which was not acceptable during a situation regarding safety. The morning of checkout I gave the hotel owner a description of the man and it did not fit anyone staying at the hotel that night (hotel only has 14 rooms so it was easy to narrow down). At the very least this hotel needs to install cameras on the back side of the building viewing the lower roof and fire escape as guests privacy is easily violated and worse situations could easily arise especially for female guests. I am more than happy to edit my review once this security issue has been resolved and the hotel sends proof of cameras installed.',1,5,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:48'),(8734,28,'Anonymous','Germany','none','1','August 2021','Group','\n August 9, 2021\n','Wonderful','','',0,9,'none','2022-06-10 16:48:48'),(8735,28,'Petrie','Netherlands','Single Room','1','July 2021','Solo traveler','\n July 23, 2021\n','Fair','I believe many of the good reviews here are fake','There was nobody to open as I arrived ( around 22:00)...no elevator to my room on the 3 th floor, very warm bedlinnen...',0,5,'Dear guest,\nsorry, but we cannot understand your rating.
